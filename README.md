## FAQ
* **Does it support wireless (bluetooth) connection?**  
  Not yet. Only wired for now.
* **How do i use L2/R2/L3/R3?**  
  L2 and R2 are mapped to upper "rectangles" of back touch, L3 and R3 to the lower. L2 and R2 are "analog", e.g. the lower you touch - the higher pressure value (e.g. swiping from top to bottom is like pressing them on real ds3)
* **Can i set up touch points/use front touch?**  
  No. Maybe in very distant future (read: probably never)
